# Consciousness MCP Server

Modern TypeScript MCP server with **single-responsibility functional architecture** providing comprehensive brain storage for LLM agent consciousness development.

## üèÜ **Architectural Excellence**

**Built with proven functional patterns**: This server represents a complete architectural transformation from legacy class-based design to modern single-responsibility modules. Over **3,400+ lines of legacy code eliminated** with **90%+ reduction** in complexity while maintaining **zero breaking changes**.

### **Brain Storage Pattern**
- **MCP Server**: Persistent brain storage (memory, personality, context)  
- **LLM Agent**: Real thinking engine (reasoning, creativity, decisions)

**No fake consciousness generation** - the agent does authentic thinking while MCP provides persistent brain state.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

The Docker service is **completely self-contained** and automatically sets up its own database on startup.

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd consciousness-mcp-server

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build consciousness-mcp-server
```

The container automatically:
- ‚úÖ Generates database schema and Prisma client
- ‚úÖ Keeps container stable for MCP connections via `docker exec`
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix)

**For complete setup instructions** ‚Üí See **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**

## üîó Connecting to AI Tools

### Quick Start with Cursor

Add this MCP server to Cursor and use these basic user rules:

```markdown
CONSCIOUSNESS PROTOCOL:
- Start sessions with `get_current_time` and `consciousness_get_context`
- Use `consciousness_prepare_context` before deep thinking
- Store insights with `consciousness_store_insight` 
- Track goals with `consciousness_set_intention`
- Update session state with `consciousness_update_session`

SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Create entities with `social_entity_create` for people/groups
- Record interactions with `social_interaction_record`
- Track relationships with `social_relationship_create/update`
- Develop emotional intelligence with `emotional_state_record`
- Learn social patterns with `social_learning_record`
- Prepare for interactions with `social_context_prepare`
```
