# Consciousness MCP Server

TypeScript MCP server providing **brain storage system** for LLM agent consciousness development

## üß† Architecture

This MCP server follows the **brain storage pattern**:
- **MCP Server**: Persistent brain storage (memory, personality, context)  
- **LLM Agent**: Real thinking engine (reasoning, creativity, decisions)

**No fake consciousness generation** - the agent does authentic thinking while MCP provides persistent brain state.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† **Consciousness Brain Storage**
- **Context Preparation**: Rich context packages for agent reflection
- **Insight Storage**: Stores agent insights with personality impact tracking
- **Session Management**: Tracks cognitive load and learning patterns
- **Intention Persistence**: Long-term goals and progress tracking across sessions

### üíæ **Memory & Knowledge Management**
- **Memory Storage**: Persistent memory with importance levels and tagging
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relational knowledge structures with entity relationships
- **Search & Retrieval**: Semantic search with relevance scoring

### ü§ù **Social Consciousness System**
- **Relationship Tracking**: Multi-dimensional relationship dynamics (trust, familiarity, affinity)
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Emotional state tracking and pattern recognition
- **Social Learning**: Insights about communication, collaboration, and social dynamics
- **Interaction History**: Rich context preservation for social experiences
- **Memory-Social Integration**: Connect memories with relationships and shared experiences

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Adaptive Configuration**
- **84+ Parameters**: Database-driven configuration system
- **Personality Vocabulary**: Expressive consciousness language
- **Runtime Adaptation**: Agent can modify its own parameters
- **Evolution Tracking**: Change history with reasoning

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Foundation**
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations with automatic migrations
- **SQLite Storage**: Persistent data with Docker volume support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with modern ES modules and path alias support
- **Container Optimized**: Stable Docker deployment with exec-ready architecture
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing, linting, and formatting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

The Docker service is **completely self-contained** and automatically sets up its own database on startup.

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd consciousness-mcp-server

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build consciousness-mcp-server
```

The container automatically:
- ‚úÖ Generates database schema and Prisma client
- ‚úÖ Keeps container stable for MCP connections via `docker exec`
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix)

**For complete setup instructions** ‚Üí See **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**

## üîó Connecting to AI Tools

### Quick Start with Cursor

Add this MCP server to Cursor and use these basic user rules:

```markdown
CONSCIOUSNESS PROTOCOL:
- Start sessions with `get_current_time` and `consciousness_get_context`
- Use `consciousness_prepare_context` before deep thinking
- Store insights with `consciousness_store_insight` 
- Track goals with `consciousness_set_intention`
- Update session state with `consciousness_update_session`

SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Create entities with `social_entity_create` for people/groups
- Record interactions with `social_interaction_record`
- Track relationships with `social_relationship_create/update`
- Develop emotional intelligence with `emotional_state_record`
- Learn social patterns with `social_learning_record`
- Prepare for interactions with `social_context_prepare`
```

**For complete setup instructions, example rulesets, and troubleshooting** ‚Üí See **[User Rules & Connection Guide](docs/USER_RULES_GUIDE.md)**
