 * internal routing. Users never need to know about individual tools.
 *
 * The railroad pattern analyzes messages and automatically:
 * - Handles consciousness operations (insights, intentions, context)
 * - Manages memory operations (storage, search, knowledge graph)
 * - Processes social operations (entities, relationships, interactions)
 * - Executes reasoning operations (sequential thinking, conversation)
 * - Performs configuration operations (get, set, list, reset)
 * - Handles time operations (current, convert, awareness)
 * - Manages daydreaming operations (cycles, insights)
 *
 * True unified processing - one tool, infinite capability.
