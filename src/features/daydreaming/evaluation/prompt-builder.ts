EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. NOVELTY (0.0-1.0): How unexpected, surprising, or original is this connection?
   - 0.0-0.3: Obvious, conventional, well-known connection
   - 0.4-0.6: Somewhat creative, has interesting aspects
   - 0.7-1.0: Highly original, surprising, breakthrough insight

2. PLAUSIBILITY (0.0-1.0): How logical, coherent, and well-reasoned is this connection?
   - 0.0-0.3: Illogical, contradictory, nonsensical
   - 0.4-0.6: Some logical basis, partially convincing
   - 0.7-1.0: Highly logical, well-reasoned, convincing

3. VALUE (0.0-1.0): How useful, interesting, or practically relevant is this insight?
   - 0.0-0.3: Not particularly useful or interesting
   - 0.4-0.6: Moderately interesting, some potential value
   - 0.7-1.0: Highly valuable, could lead to important insights

4. ACTIONABILITY (0.0-1.0): Does this connection suggest concrete next steps or applications?
   - 0.0-0.3: Abstract with no clear applications
   - 0.4-0.6: Some potential applications, needs development
   - 0.7-1.0: Clear actionable implications, ready to pursue
