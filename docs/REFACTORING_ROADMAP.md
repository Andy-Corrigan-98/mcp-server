# Refactoring Roadmap

## ✅ Completed (July 2025)

### Social Tools Architecture Migration
- **Pattern**: Class-based → Functional with single-responsibility modules
- **Impact**: 2,495+ lines → ~400 lines (90%+ reduction)
- **Structure**: Each function gets its own file with exactly one reason to change

```
src/features/social/
├── entities/          # 7 focused modules (create, update, get-by-id, etc.)
├── relationships/     # 8 focused modules (create, update, delete, etc.) 
└── index.ts          # Functional composition
```

### Removed Legacy
- All class-based social tools (`social-tools.ts`, `entity-manager.ts`, etc.)
- Complex inheritance hierarchies and singleton patterns
- 787-line test file for deleted architecture

## 🎯 Next Priority Areas

### 1. Apply Single-Responsibility to Other Features
**Candidates for same treatment:**
- `src/tools/consciousness/consciousness-tools.ts` (large file)
- `src/tools/memory/memory-tools.ts` (multiple responsibilities)
- `src/tools/reasoning/reasoning-tools.ts` (complex logic)

### 2. Service Layer Consolidation
**Current functional services working well:**
- `src/services/database.ts` 
- `src/services/configuration.ts`
- `src/services/validation.ts`
- `src/utils/responses.ts`

**Consider extending pattern to:**
- Other utility areas
- Cross-cutting concerns

### 3. Base Classes Cleanup
**Investigate removal candidates:**
- `src/tools/social/base/` (may be unused after class removal)
- Other abstract base classes throughout codebase

## 🏗️ Established Patterns

### Single-Responsibility Module Structure
```typescript
// Each operation gets its own file
feature/
├── load-config.ts     # Configuration only
├── create.ts          # Creation logic only  
├── update.ts          # Update logic only
├── get-by-id.ts       # ID queries only
├── get-by-name.ts     # Name queries only
├── list.ts            # Listing/filtering only
├── delete.ts          # Deletion only
└── index.ts           # Barrel exports
```

### Function Design Principles
- Pure functions with explicit dependencies
- No side effects or hidden state
- Easy to test and compose
- Clear single responsibility

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

1. **Pick a feature area** (consciousness, memory, or reasoning)
2. **Analyze current structure** - identify distinct responsibilities
3. **Create single-responsibility modules** - one function per file
4. **Update imports** - use barrel exports pattern
5. **Remove legacy classes** - after functional verification
6. **Test thoroughly** - ensure no regressions

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Lines of code reduction** (target: 80%+ like social)
- **Test simplification** (pure functions easier to test)
- **Clear separation** (each file has one reason to change)
- **Maintainability** (easier to find and modify specific logic)

## 🔧 Current Status

- Social tools: ✅ Complete
- Todo list: 🔄 Update needed
- Next target: ⏳ To be determined
