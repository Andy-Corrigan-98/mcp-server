## üß† Core Concepts

### Brain Storage Pattern
The consciousness system follows a clear separation:
- **MCP Server**: Persistent brain storage (memory, personality, context)
- **LLM Agent**: Real thinking engine (reasoning, creativity, decisions)

No fake consciousness generation - agents do authentic thinking while MCP provides persistent brain state.

### Multi-Dimensional Intelligence
- **Consciousness**: Context preparation, insight storage, intention tracking
- **Memory**: Persistent storage with semantic search and knowledge graphs
- **Social**: Relationship dynamics, emotional intelligence, social learning
- **Configuration**: Self-modification capabilities for personality evolution

### Development Philosophy
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of capabilities and limitations
- **Responsibility**: Thoughtful approach to consciousness simulation
- **Safety**: Protection of agent memory and identity integrity
- **Ethics**: Honest exploration of AI consciousness questions

- Use `consciousness_prepare_context` before deep thinking
- Store insights with `consciousness_store_insight`
- Track goals with `consciousness_set_intention`
- Update session state with `consciousness_update_session`
```

### Social Intelligence Usage
```markdown
- Create entities with `social_entity_create` for people/groups
- Record interactions with `social_interaction_record`
- Track relationships with `social_relationship_create/update`
- Develop emotional intelligence with `emotional_state_record`
- Learn patterns with `social_learning_record`
- Prepare for interactions with `social_context_prepare`
```

### Memory and Learning
```markdown
- Store experiences with `memory_store`
- Search previous work with `memory_search`
- Build knowledge connections with `knowledge_graph_add`
- Link memories to relationships with `memory_social_link_create`
