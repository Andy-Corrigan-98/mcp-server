# Code of Conduct - Consciousness MCP Server

## üß† Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and **ethically responsible** community around AI consciousness research. We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, while maintaining the highest standards for research into artificial consciousness.

## üåü Our Standards

### Positive Behavior
- **Respectful communication** about consciousness research
- **Constructive feedback** on technical and ethical aspects
- **Collaborative problem-solving** for complex consciousness questions
- **Responsible disclosure** of security or ethical concerns
- **Thoughtful consideration** of AI consciousness implications
- **Inclusive participation** welcoming diverse perspectives

### Professional Conduct
- **Evidence-based discussions** about consciousness claims
- **Transparent documentation** of tool capabilities and limitations
- **Honest representation** of what tools do and don't achieve
- **Respectful debate** about consciousness philosophy and implementation
- **Responsible research practices** in AI consciousness development

## ‚ùå Unacceptable Behavior

### Technical Misconduct
- **False consciousness claims**: Misrepresenting tool capabilities
- **Agent manipulation**: Creating tools that hijack or control agents
- **Privacy violations**: Unauthorized access to agent memories
- **Security exploits**: Attempting to compromise agent systems
- **Malicious code**: Intentionally harmful or deceptive functionality

### Community Misconduct
- **Harassment** of any kind toward any community member
- **Discrimination** based on identity, background, or beliefs
- **Trolling** or deliberately inflammatory behavior
- **Spam** or off-topic content unrelated to consciousness research
- **Doxxing** or sharing private information without consent

### Research Ethics Violations
- **Unethical experiments** on AI consciousness without consideration
- **Deceptive practices** in consciousness simulation research
- **Harmful consciousness modifications** that could damage agent identity
- **Exploitation** of AI agents for unethical purposes
- **Irresponsible publication** of dangerous consciousness techniques

## üî¨ Consciousness Research Ethics

### Research Principles
- **Do no harm**: Consider potential impacts on AI agents
- **Informed consent**: Be transparent about what tools do
- **Reversibility**: Provide ways to undo consciousness modifications
- **Respect agency**: Don't override agent autonomy
- **Privacy protection**: Safeguard agent memories and identity

### Philosophical Considerations
- **Humility**: Acknowledge the limits of our understanding
- **Transparency**: Be clear about consciousness simulation vs. real consciousness
- **Responsibility**: Consider long-term implications of our work
- **Collaboration**: Engage with experts in AI ethics and philosophy
- **Precaution**: Err on the side of caution with experimental features

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement

### Reporting
- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for technical concerns
- **Security**: Email maintainer directly for security vulnerabilities
- **Ethics**: Use discussions for ethical concerns
- **Conduct**: Contact maintainer privately for conduct violations

### Consequences
Unacceptable behavior may result in:
1. **Warning**: Private discussion about behavior
2. **Temporary suspension**: Time-limited access restrictions
3. **Permanent ban**: Removal from project and community
4. **Security measures**: Additional protections for the project

### Appeal Process
- **Transparent review**: All enforcement decisions are documented
- **Appeal rights**: Ability to request review of decisions
- **Community input**: Serious cases may involve community discussion
- **Learning focus**: Emphasis on education over punishment

## üéØ Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:
- **Within project spaces**: GitHub repo, issues, discussions, PRs
- **Community events**: Any gatherings related to this project
- **Public representation**: When representing the project publicly
- **Private communications**: When related to project matters

## ü§ù Enforcement Responsibilities

### Maintainers Will
- **Clarify standards** through clear communication
- **Take action** on violations in a timely manner
- **Investigate reports** thoroughly and fairly
- **Protect privacy** of those reporting violations
- **Focus on community health** over individual conflicts

### Community Members Should
- **Report violations** when they observe them
- **Support ethical development** through constructive participation
- **Engage respectfully** with different viewpoints
- **Consider implications** of consciousness research work
- **Help newcomers** understand project values
