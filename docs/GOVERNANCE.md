# Repository Governance

## 🛡️ Repository Protection Strategy

This document outlines how this repository is configured to enable **safe experimentation** while **protecting the core framework** from unauthorized changes.

## 🎯 Collaboration Models

### 1. **Fork for Experimentation** (Primary Approach)
- **What**: Create your own fork of this repository
- **Benefits**: 
  - Complete freedom to experiment
  - No impact on the main repository
  - Can sync updates from upstream
  - Can share your experiments independently
- **How**: Click "Fork" on GitHub, then customize as needed
- **Best for**: Personal experiments, agent-specific adaptations, research

### 2. **Template Repository Usage**
- **What**: Use this as a template to create a new repository
- **Benefits**:
  - Clean start with no git history
  - No connection to the original repository
  - Complete ownership of your version
- **How**: Click "Use this template" when creating a new repository
- **Best for**: Production deployments, commercial use, major modifications

### 3. **Contribute to Core Framework**
- **What**: Submit changes back to the main repository
- **Requirements**: 
  - Ethics and security review
  - Community discussion for major changes
  - Maintainer approval
- **Process**: Issue → Discussion → Approved PR
- **Best for**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, general enhancements

## 🔒 Technical Protection Measures

### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
main branch protection:
  - Require PR reviews: 1+ maintainer
  - Dismiss stale reviews: true
  - Require status checks: all CI passes
  - Include administrators: true
  - Restrict pushes: maintainers only
  - Allow force pushes: false
  - Allow deletions: false
```

### Automated Security Checks
- **Dependency scanning**: Automatic vulnerability detection via Dependabot
